                    <p>
                      For the past 10 years I have been volunteering at an animal shelter. 
                      Helping those animals makes me feel truly alive. Not only has
                      it been done in one place, but also has visited several shelters overseas 
                      to conduct a survey on the actual conditions. Many of these experiences
                      have now made Toronto's small shelters in charge of management of a small shelter. 
                      I have no doubt that I will spend my rest of my life for rescuing and protecting animals.

                I'm interested in many things as well as animal rescue. 
                In my free time, I like to read books and watch movies at the movie theater. 
                During the day, I like to chat with my friend at a cafe, and on hot days, 
                I leave to find a place to surf. In Toronto, where winter is long, I also enjoy skiing in winter. 
                I want to spend the rest of my days finding more fun!
